We live in a world where computers govern most of the day-to-day tasks. Computers are almost everywhere, at your school, at your desk, in your kitchen, in your bedroom, there's one lying in your pocket and the one you're reading this article on. Not all computers need an Operating System (OS), it depends on the niche of the computer, the computer that controls the refrigerator or oven in your kitchen, for example, doesn't require an operating system. However, In this article, we are dealing with the operating systems running on digital computers. All desktop and mobile devices have Operating Systems underneath them, serving a different purpose. Students (particularly online students), freelancers, and anyone who owns a phone, computer, or tablet should learn about different OSs so they can pick a computer and OS that meet their needs. If you’re planning to study IT in school and pursue an IT career, you’ll want a firm knowledge of OSs to make sure you’re prepared for all the skills you’ll need to be successful in your field.

## So, what is an Operating System?
The fact which many seldom talk about is what makes these computers work the way they do. Without an operating system, a computer cannot simply function. From a 5th grade perspective, an OS is what basically keeps your devices running and functional (Isn't that electricity?). Yes, electricity power up your hardware but OS is what makes better use of them and governs the way certain hardware behaves. Now let's dig deep into the technical aspects of an Operating System. An operating system (OS) is a set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. It acts as an intermediary of sorts between programs and the computer hardware, manages the software resources of the system. In computers, tablets, and smartphones, these hardware and software resources include the processors, memory, disk space, GUI, application software, etc. It provides a stable, consistent way for applications to deal with the hardware without having to know all the details of the hardware.

## Do Operating Systems matter? Why so many OSs?

You’ve probably been a part of the 'Linux vs Windows' or 'iOS vs Android' argument on social media platforms like Reddit where everyone seems to have very strong opinions on their choice, claiming the superiority of the OS they use but what it really comes down to is their personal preference in operating systems. Most people know what OS they like, depending on their personal experience. They may say they like a particular feature of the OS or they enjoy some pre-installed software, the look, and feel of the applications or systems they can download, or even the pre-installed web browser. But, the fact is that every OS is unique and serves a special purpose. It will be too early to conclude about which operating system is the best in the market.

## Leading Operating Systems (2021)
Though there are tons of Operating systems in the market, credit goes to many Linux distros but there are only a few Operating Systems that are actually showing their presence in the market including the Windows family of OS with 36% of the market share, the android with 39% (highest), iOS with 15%, OS X with 7% and Linux, merely 0.8% and rest are other OSs, not worth mentioning.

## Which OS is the best?
As we already said, the choice of OS is personal freedom to have, choose your OS depending on what work you'll be doing. For home use, traditional Windows and macOS are great options. At home, you don’t need a powerful OS especially for simple tasks like writing or browsing files and the web or even programming. In fact, people prefer windows over Mac and Linux as developers are more biased towards creating games for windows than any other OS out there. But which OS is fastest among all?
While discussing the fastest OS, Linux-based OS is the lightest and fastest OS in the market right now, there's no doubt about it. It doesn’t need a powerful processor unlike Windows to operate at an optimal level. Linux supports every kind of configuration and has a great level of customizability.
